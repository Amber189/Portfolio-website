      <h1>+Acumen Human Centered Design</h1>
        <span>This was a volunteer based project to discover and practice the IDEO Human Centered Design Process</span>

      <section>
      <ul>
        <li>Objective — Come up with a prototype solution based on research and interviews for providing healthier food options.</li>

        <li>Project duration — Total of 27 hours. We met up 1 day a week for 9 weeks. </li>

       <li>Team — Ellen Coonrod (project lead), Jenn D, Rigo, Kim, Jake and Amber Wells.</li>

       <li>Your role — Everyone was to contribute ideas and feedback. I like to ask questions to help stimulate the the team. During the prototype phase we split the duties and Rigo and I were in charge of writing content.  </li>

       <li>Final product showcase — An ad for social media posts or websites introducing the group and inviting to meetups.<img src="img/ideation-hmw_opt.jpg" alt="Image of sticky note process for How Might We... " class="style-img"></li>

        <h5>Design Challenge</h5>
        <h2>How might we provide healthier food options for people in need?</h2>

          <p>Design problem/challenge — In many neighborhoods, there is little infrasturcture for the distribution and preservation of food. Food is often spoiled or lost during distribution. In other places, healthy food options are simply unavailable or community members lack the knowledge to make healthy food choices. Another constraint is access to capital, both for small businesses providing healthy food as well as potential customers.
           </p>

           <h5>Research</h5>
           <h2>User Survey and Expert Interview</h2>

           <p>User research — <!-- Describe your users in terms of their needs, motivation and pain points. This part can include the tools that you used to find this information (like Personas, empathy maps, etc). You can also mention a competitive analysis (assess the strengths and weaknesses of competitors against your user’s needs). -->
             The challenge led us toward low-income families and from our interviews there was a lack of education and awareness when it came to what was healthy, how to prepare food and even local resources. As a part of a survey we discovered, among other things, that most people define healthy as "minimally process and high in nutritional value".
           </p>

           <p>Expert research- Melissa worked for the Texas Agriculture Extension Office as a Program Coordinator for Better Living for Texas. She provides nutrition education funded by SNAP, teaches people receiving food stamps to make healthier choices and stretch their dollars. The ironic thing was that these classes were during the day and most people were unable to attend and those that did had been unaware that anything like this class existed for free.</p>

            <p> What these people enjoyed and learned most from were the cooking classes. Not that they were  uninterested in nutrition but that they needed to take care of their basic survival needs. Most were under the assumption that eating healthy was expensive and had to be organic. Knowledge and experience in the kitchen has been extinguished over the years thanks to the popularity of frozen and boxed meals, complete with directions on the back. Minimal time and skill and minimal nutritional value. Cooking fresh produce along with protein and grains can be inexpensive and provides more quality and quantity for your dollar.</p>

           <h5></h5>
           <h2></h2>

           <p>Ideation —  <!--Here you should provide answers on following questions: How did you solve the problem? Why did you choose that particular solution, and what influenced your decision? -->
             Clustering our in our information into themes we found that issues regarding healthy eating stemmed around: time/planning, marketing/merchandising, knowledge.
          </p>

           <img src="img/ideation-storyboard_opt.jpg" alt="Persona storyboard image and description" class="style-img">

           <p>Ideation —  <!--More stuff on ideation. Maybe a blockquote?  -->Using these themes to create three insight statements and used colored dots to vote. What we came up with was "All 5 senses are used, especially sight, when making decisions", "People like to use tools that reduce time in the kitchen", "Knowledge is power".
          </p>

          <p>This slowly became a difficult process simply because of the time of day. Our meetings were Thursday 6pm-9pm and a lot of us became mentally drained by this point. When it came to participation, some of us were picking up the slack of others. We began to recognize the importance of snacks and breaks to keep the energy and morale up.</p>

          <p>We were able to form "How Might We..." to form questions that use these insights explore solutions to our challenge. Working individually we then shared our ideas and again, voted with colored dots to find the best option. "How might we stimulate the consumer's senses to make healthier food decisions?", "How might we inform people of time-saving tips, tricks and tools?", "How might we encourage community support of families to make healthy eating decisions."</p>

          <p>These questions stimulated a range of ideas from graphitti and advertisements to augmented reality and festivals. We all were convinced that a social group with cooking meetups would be able to tie many of these ideas and also speak to all three of our "HMW" questions.<p>

          <h5>Design</h5>
          <h2>Social Marketing Ad</h2>

           <p>Design — <!--It’s essential to describes how you went from insights to conception, to solution and and impact. Show wireframes, Lo/Hi fidelity mockups, and working prototypes. Employers need to know that you can do these, and can think through the detail that a developer will need. If possible, add an interactive prototype (such as inVision) to allow reviewers to play with it. -->Beginning with a persona based on our research, we found mostly women in their 30's with children were interested in healthy meals. Our persona Carina was 36 year old single mom who worked as a LVN
         </p>

          <p>Testing — <!--How did you measure success / failure? How did you test your solution? What questions did you ask?</p>-->Unfortunately, the course ends after completion of the prototype however, we did manage to send it out to a few people for feedback. Most seemed interested in the group and the only thing that would prevent them from attending a meetup is scheduling conflicts. The more dates, opportunities and members we have, the more inclined people are to attend. Proper marketing and advertising of the group should be a priority for success.</P>

          <p>Conclusion- Reminding myself that we are solving a problem for other people. "I am not the user", everyone is different and has their unique needs. Upon completion of the project, I have a more solid understanding of what might have been important to document and take photos of along the way, and types of questions to ask. I walked away with a deeper sense of empathy, a stronger approach to creativity and the ability to be specific, factual and ask proper questions. Design can be an art created for the benefit of the user.  In all, I found this to be a successful introduction to Human Centered Design. </p>
