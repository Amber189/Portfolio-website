      <h1>+Acumen Introduction to Human Centered Design</h1>
        <span>An online course built in collaboration with IDEO.org. Our team of six followed the IDEO principals of UX Design to talk to real people in order to understand their needs and prototype solutions.</span>

      <h2>Successes</h2>
        <p>This was a awesome, respectful team to work with. Our design challenge was "How might we provide healthier food options to those in need". I walked away with a deeper sense of empathy, a stronger approach to creativity and the ability to be specific, factual and ask proper questions. Design can be an art created for the benefit of the user. </p>
      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Letting go of ideas that I wanted to work.</li>

        <li>When it came to participation and feedback, some group members were picking up the slack. </li>

       <li>Approaching people to speak with.</li>

       <li>Documenting the process.</p>

      </ul>

        <h2>Adapt and Overcome</h2>

          <p>Reminding myself that we are solving a problem for other people. "I am not the user", everyone is different and has their unique needs.
           </p>
           <p>Working on anything creative and mentally demanding requires a lot of energy and focus. Frequent breaks and healthy snacks for energy and boost morale.
           </p>
           <p>Reaching out to friends, relatives and their extensions is a good start for field research. With practice it will become easier to talk to strangers and refine the approach.
          </p>
          <p>Upon completion of the project, I have a more solid understanding of what might have been important to document along the way, take photos of and questions to ask. Proper storage and labeling of assets is just as important as the information itself.
