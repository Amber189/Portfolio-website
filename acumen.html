      <ul>
        <li><em>Objective</em> — Come up with a prototype solution based on research and interviews for providing healthier food options.</li>

        <li><em>Project duration</em> — Total of 27 hours. We met up 1 day a week for 9 weeks. </li>

       <li><em>Team</em> — Ellen Coonrod (project lead), Jenn Dureja, Rigo Zevada, Kim Egner, Jake Garcia and Amber Wells.</li>

       <li><em>My role</em> — I enjoyed contributing ideas, feedback and asking questions to help stimulate the the team. Setup and interview our expert and present to team. During the prototype phase, we split the duties and Rigo and I were in charge of writing content.  </li>

       <li><em>Final product showcase</em> — An ad for social media posts or websites introducing the group and inviting to meetups.

        <h5>Design Challenge</h5>
        <h2>How might we provide healthier food options for people in need?</h2>

          <p>In many neighborhoods, there is little infrasturcture for the distribution and preservation of food. Food is often spoiled or lost during distribution. In other places, healthy food options are simply unavailable or community members lack the knowledge to make healthy food choices. Another constraint is access to capital, both for small businesses providing healthy food as well as potential customers.
           </p>
           <p>From distribution and availabilty to business capital and consumer knowledge. Having readily available and healthy food options can become a challenge for anyone. This challenge could be solved from any direction but after discussing, our team decided on solving the challenge for low income families and creating healthy meals at home.

           <h5>Inspiration</h5>
           <h2>User Survey and Expert Interview</h2>

           <p>User research — <!-- Describe your users in terms of their needs, motivation and pain points. This part can include the tools that you used to find this information (like Personas, empathy maps, etc). You can also mention a competitive analysis (assess the strengths and weaknesses of competitors against your user’s needs). -->
             We made plans and interviewed a family of 4 and Jen sent out surveys to a mom's group to gather formal data.  We discovered, among other things, that most people define healthy as "minimally process and high in nutritional value". Working full-time with a hungry family is difficult and the easier option tends to be the unhealthy option.

             <p> We also observed people shopping at grocery stores in low-income areas as well as in fast food resturaunts where healthy options were available. Marketing, advertising, bright colors, location and strategic placement. It was clear that what was being advertised and purchased was un-healthy.  </p>
           </p>

           <p>Expert Interview - Melissa worked for the Texas Agriculture Extension Office as a Program Coordinator for Better Living for Texas. She provides nutrition education funded by SNAP, teaches people receiving food stamps to make healthier choices and stretch their dollars. </p>

           <blockquote>" There is limited forethought and planning for meals. They use the money they have on hand to go through a drive-thru not realizing what that same $20 can do in a grocery store"</blockquote>

            <p> What these people enjoyed and learned most from were the cooking classes. Not that they were uninterested in nutrition but that they needed to take care of their basic survival needs. Most were under the assumption that eating healthy was expensive. The passing of knowledge and experience in the kitchen has been extinguished over the years thanks to the popularity of frozen and boxed meals and convience foods. Minimal time and skill with minimal nutritional value. Most families haven't been informed or taught that cooking simple and healthy meals can still be inexpensive and can also provide more quality and quantity for your dollar.</p>

           <h5>Ideation</h5>
           <h2>Synthesis</h2>

           <p> <!--Here you should provide answers on following questions: How did you solve the problem? Why did you choose that particular solution, and what influenced your decision? -->
             Clustering our in our information and research into themes we found that issues regarding healthy eating stemmed around: time/planning, marketing/merchandising, knowledge.
          </p>


           <p> <!--More stuff on ideation. Maybe a blockquote?  -->Using these themes we created insight statements and then used colored dots to vote on the 3 most favorable and profound: "All 5 senses are used, especially sight, when making decisions", "People like to use tools that reduce time in the kitchen", "Knowledge is power".
          </p>

          <!-- <p>This slowly became a difficult process simply because of the time of day. Our meetings were Thursday 6pm-9pm and a lot of us became mentally drained by this point. When it came to participation, some of us were picking up the slack of others. We began to recognize the importance of snacks and breaks to keep the energy and morale up.</p> -->

          <p>To form a solveable question  we used the "How Might We..." method using the insights to explore solutions to our challenge. Working individually we then shared our ideas and again, voted with colored dots to find the best option. "How might we stimulate the consumer's senses to make healthier food decisions?", "How might we inform people of time-saving tips, tricks and tools?", "How might we encourage community support of families to make healthy eating decisions."</p>


          <p>These questions stimulated a range of ideas from graphitti and advertisements to augmented reality and festivals. We all were convinced that a social group with cooking meetups would be able to tie-in many of these ideas and also speak to all three of our "HMW" questions.<p>

          <h5>Implimentation</h5>
          <h2>Social Marketing Ad</h2>

           <p>Design — <!--It’s essential to describes how you went from insights to conception, to solution and and impact. Show wireframes, Lo/Hi fidelity mockups, and working prototypes. Employers need to know that you can do these, and can think through the detail that a developer will need. If possible, add an interactive prototype (such as inVision) to allow reviewers to play with it. -->Beginning with a persona based on our research, we found mostly women in their 30's with children were interested in healthy meal options. Our persona Carina was busy 36 year old single mom who worked as a LVN.
         </p>



         <p>We knew that a meetup style group that could share tips, tricks, diets, and even meals was the way to go. But the question we had to answer was how would someone like Carina hear about this group and would she go?</p>


         <div class="dual-photo acumen" >
         <img src="img/ideation-storyboard_opt.jpg" alt="Persona storyboard image and description" class="style-img HCDimage">

          <img src="img/HealthyMealsOnABudgetAd_SocialMediaLinks.jpeg" alt="Ad for Healthy Meals on a Budget social group" class="style-img HCDimage">
        </div>

         <p>Similar to a flyer, ad or post we wanted to make something flexible that delivered the needed information quickly. This ad can be customized in all forms of advertising. Posters on community boards, flyers in grocery bags, posts on social media and email attachments. Ilicit curiosity and who wouldn't come for free food?

          <p>Testing — <!--How did you measure success / failure? How did you test your solution? What questions did you ask?</p>-->Unfortunately, the course ends after completion of the prototype however, we did manage to send it out to a few people for feedback. Most seemed interested in the group and the only thing that would prevent them from attending a meetup is scheduling conflicts. Perceiveably, more opportunities and members could build more attendance. Proper marketing and advertising of the group as well as good leadership should be a priority for success.</P>

          <p>Conclusion- Reminding myself that we are solving a problem for other people. "I am not the user", everyone is different and has their unique needs. Upon completion of the project, I have a more solid understanding of what might have been important to document and take photos of along the way, and types of questions to ask. I walked away with a deeper sense of empathy, a stronger approach to creativity and the ability to be specific, factual and ask proper questions. Design can be an art created for the benefit of the user.  In all, I found this to be a successful introduction to Human Centered Design. </p>
